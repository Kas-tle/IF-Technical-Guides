## About
[BedrockConnect](https://github.com/Pugmatt/BedrockConnect) works by essentially initiating a man-in-the middle attack on the domain of the featured servers. Basically, this means that when the device attempts to look up the IP of, say, Hypixel, from its domain, BedrockConnect's DNS server will instead return the IP of the BedrockConnect server list server, which will allow you to join IF.

## DNS Method
- Change the primary DNS server on your device to 104.238.130.180 and the secondary DNS server to 1.1.1.1
- If you are on PS4, use 173.82.100.84 as your primary DNS
- If you cannot connect, refer to the [troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/Pugmatt/BedrockConnect/wiki/Troubleshooting)

## Hosting a Local BedrockConnect Instance
- If you run into trouble with the DNS method, consider hosting a local instance of BedrockConnect on an availible device
- Download the [latest release](https://github.com/Pugmatt/BedrockConnect/releases)
- Assuming you are cd to the directory containing the jar, run:
  - `java -jar BedrockConnect-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar nodb=true`
- On Windows, command prompt may not use a current 64-bit JRE, so you will need to fix this by referring to this [guide](https://www.happycoders.eu/java/how-to-switch-multiple-java-versions-windows/)
- Once running, connect via the friends tab
